When flying a general aviation aircraft, such as a 4 seat 1961 Cessna Skylark 175B, it is important to calculate the total weight and the center of gravity of the airplane before takeoff. The weight can vary depending on how much fuel is on board, luggage, and passengers. The center of gravity (CG), or balance, of the aircraft is important because the aircraft will handle very differently if the CG is outside of the designed envelope. This tool automates those calculations to ensure the aircraft is safe to fly.

WARNING-THIS TOOL SHOULD ONLY BE USED TO CHECK YOUR OWN HAND CALCULATIONS. THE AUTHOR OF THIS ARTICLE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ERRORS THAT EXIST IN THIS TOOL OR ERRORS IN ITS OPERATION. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

To use, simply enter the weights you wish to compute in the green cells and confirm you are still within the designed operating envelope of the aircraft. Be especially careful of aft CG and being overweight.
