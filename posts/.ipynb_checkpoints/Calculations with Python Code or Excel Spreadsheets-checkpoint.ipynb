    "# To code or not to code  \n",
    "When faced with a technical challenge or problem solving, conceptual understanding is an important first step, and I almost always start with hand calculations. Once I feel that I have a grasp of the concept, then I turn to a digital approach which often involves using excel or python and running some numbers, and re-running them, and fiddling until I really understand. I always feel like, especially in engineering, that using the right tool for the right job can make a big difference in the results. [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel) or [Libre Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) spreadsheet programs are a great way to plug some numbers in and perform simple calculations with nearly no learning curve to get an answer. But as the complexity and quantity of the data and compuation increases, spreadsheets start to not make sense. That's where I feel a code based calculation method is important tool in everyones analysis toolbox. Classicaly, good old pencil and paper was the only way to model and work out problems. But, with the availability of the personal computer, software has allowed us to do more work with less effort. I find it very fascinating to see how people solve problems. This post will explore that idea and hopefully give you an idea to go beyond excel the next time you need to run some numbers.\n",
